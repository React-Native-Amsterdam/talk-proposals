# Speak at React Native Amsterdam

First of all, thank you for thinking about submitting a talk to an upcoming React Native Amsterdam event. We're very happy that you are here!

## How do I submit a talk?

[Open an issue](https://github.com/react-native-amsterdam/talk-proposals/issues/new/choose) on this repo and use one of our issue templates to guide you through your talk submission.

If you need any help with this process because you are new to GitHub, Git or speaking in general, send us a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ReactNativeAMS). Happy to help any way we can!

## What should I talk about?

Anything you're passionate about that is related to the React Native or JavaScript ecosystem.

## How long should my talk be?

At every event, we plan to have a mix of 25 to 30 minutes talks and 10 to 15 minutes lightning talks. So do whatever you feel most comfortable with! If you need longer to present, please let us know so we can adjust the schedule or coordinate with the venue.

## Can you pay for my flights?

There's a good chance that we can afford to bring you here if you're coming from a reasonable distance. If you'd like to speak at an upcoming meetup and need travel assistance for any reason, please mention it in your talk proposal and we'll let you know if it's possible.

## What's the talk selection process?

Talk slots are first come, first served (for the most part). After you open your issue, one of the organizers will reach out and let you know the next steps :tada:
